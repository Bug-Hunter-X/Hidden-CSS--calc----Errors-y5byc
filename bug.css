The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, if there is a syntax error in the `calc()` expression, the entire property may be ignored. The error might not be immediately obvious and could lead to unexpected layout issues or other visual glitches.  For example, missing an operator or incorrect parentheses can cause this.

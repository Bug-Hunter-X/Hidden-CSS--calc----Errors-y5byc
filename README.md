This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS bug related to syntax errors within the `calc()` function.  Incorrectly formatted `calc()` expressions can silently fail, resulting in unexpected behavior. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `solution.css` provides the corrected version. This example highlights the importance of carefully reviewing and testing `calc()` expressions to avoid these hidden errors.
